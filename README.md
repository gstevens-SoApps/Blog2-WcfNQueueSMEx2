Code for the blog article "SO Apps 2, WcfNQueueSMEx2 â€“ To be Determined" at  https://dotnetsilverlightprism.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/TobeDetermined/

*  THIS Iteration 2 PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION and may not work!!  The blog article has not yet been written.
*  An SO App is a Service Oriented App.  
*  Please read the Setup Instructions document for how to install ServiceModelEx and setup Azure to support this code.
*  
ITERATION 2 PLAN
1. Design and implement a Visual Studio solution structure ammenable to service oriented apps -- A very flat structure so that the resueable components can easily be seen by scrolling, rather than expanding a deep hierarchy of folders that serves to hide components.
2. Design and implement the Data Feed subsystem per the IDesign Method, using Engines and DataAccessors to do the work, leaving only the orchestration of the work to the Manager code.
3. Stretch Goal -- Add a second Manager to demonstrate Manager to Manager interactions and more microservices.  This may not happen till Itertion 3.
