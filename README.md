Code for the blog article "SO Apps 2, WcfNQueueSMEx2 â€“ To be Determined" at  https://dotnetsilverlightprism.wordpress.com/2015/05/12/TobeDetermined/

*  THIS PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNDER CONSTRUCTION and may not work!!  The blog article has not yet been written.
*  An SO App is a Service Oriented App.  
*  Please read the Setup Instructions document for how to install ServiceModelEx and setup Azure to support this code.

ITERATION 2 PLAN
1. Design and implement a Visulat Studio solution structure ammenable to service oriented apps -- A very flat structure so that the resueable components can easily be seen by scrolling, rather than expanding a deep hierarchy of folders.
2. Design and implement the Data Feed subsystem per the IDesign Method, using Engines and DataAccessors to do the work, leaving only the orchestration of the work to the Manager.
3. Stretch Goal -- Add a second Manager to demonstrate Manager to Manager interactions.  This may not happen till Itertion 3.
